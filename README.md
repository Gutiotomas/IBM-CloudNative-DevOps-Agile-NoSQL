In this course I learned how to create a base pipeline, specify and pass parameteres to a task and pipeline. Also, how to modify the pipeline to reference the task and configure its parameters. Furthermore I learned how to pass additional parameters to a pipeline and how to run it to echo and clone a Git repository using Docker.

Moreover, I learned how set up a Kanban Board using projects and to create new stories in GitHub using Issues in GitHub and a User Story template. I also learned how to quickly prioritize the product backlog.
